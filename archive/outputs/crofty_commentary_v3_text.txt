=== DAVID CROFTY STYLE F1 COMMENTARY - HUNGARY 2024 (V3) ===

1. INCIDENT:
   AND HERE WE GO! We're on to lap 2, and Verstappen in the Red Bull is looking strong! He takes the start of the lap, and he's already showing the speed, 246 kilometers per hour as he approaches turn 1. BUT WAIT, WHAT'S THIS? The telemetry is telling us he's got a bit of a slide, just a hint of it, but he's correcting beautifully now. Brake pressure, it's 3000 Newtons, just enough to slow him down, and he's still in control. 

AND THEN HE'S GONE! Verstappen is leaving the track, taking the inside line and gaining a vital advantage over his rivals. The speedo's reading 244 kilometers per hour now, but what impresses me is the way he's carrying that speed through the turn, minimal lockup on the tires, and he's still accelerating out of the corner. The gear is in, I think it's 6th gear, and the revs are at 12,000 RPM. 

UNBELIEVABLE! This is what we've been waiting for, folks, real racing. And he's just gaining on the car ahead, Bottas in the Mercedes.

2. INCIDENT:
   OH MY GOODNESS! We are on the third lap of this thrilling Grand Prix and it's already been a lap to remember, but for all the wrong reasons for Max Verstappen in his Red Bull Racing car, number one! The stewards are investigating an incident at Turn 1, and it's clear that the Dutch driver has left the track and gained an advantage.

AND NOW WE SEE THE TELECRAFT DATA COMING IN! Max Verstappen, lap number two, was clocked at 244.0 kilometers per hour, with a lap time of 1:24.026. But here comes his next lap... HE'S COMING IN HOT! He's going into Turn 1, and... OH MY GOODNESS, HE'S LOST CONTROL, GONE WIDE, AND RE-GAINED THE TRACK!

The stewards are furious, you can tell! Max Verstappen has gained a significant advantage, and the crowd is on the edge of their seats. The data is telling us that he's got a top speed of 249.0 kilometers per hour on his second sector. BUT LOOK AT THE BRAKE PRESSURE! He's applied 4.5 bars of pressure going into Turn 3,

3. INCIDENT:
   AND HERE WE GO! Lap 4 is underway, and it's absolute pandemonium out there! Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in the red car is putting the hammer down, but he's made a mistake, a calamitous error that's put him under pressure! Look at the telemetry, folks, his lap 4 was a disaster - 249.0 km/h, but a whopping 2 seconds slower than his previous lap! What's gone wrong here?

AND LOOK AT THE BRAKE PRESSURE! Charles is slamming on the anchors at Turn 1, 4.25 G worth of deceleration, that's some serious braking power! But he's understeering, folks, he's lost traction, and now he's drifting wide! You can see it all on the telemetry, his speed's dropped, and his lap time's blown out!

AND NOW HE'S GAINING GROUND! The stewards are going to have a look at this one, and I've got to say, it's a close call. Turn 1, he's gained an advantage, but has he gained an unfair one? The telemetry says he was 2nd on the previous lap, but he's now 3rd

4. POSITION_CHANGE:
   AND HERE WE GO! We're into lap 15, and the action is unfolding right before our eyes. STR is in the midst of a nightmare, losing grip and momentum at an alarming rate. The time is ticking, and the lap time is now reading 1:44.868, a massive 16.771 seconds slower than his previous lap!

OH MY GOODNESS! Let's take a closer look at the telemetry data. SpeedI1 has dropped by 5.0 km/h, and SpeedI2 has actually remained steady, but that's not the only issue - Sector1Time has increased by a whopping 19.260 seconds, a stark contrast to the Sector2Time, which has only seen a tiny -0.016-second improvement. It's clear that STR is struggling to get out of the corners, and it's costing him dearly.

BREATHTAKING! We're seeing significant anomalies in the data - a 16.771-second lap time change, a 19.260-second increase in Sector1Time, and a 2.473-second improvement in Sector3Time. It's as if STR has lost control of the car, and it's spiraling out of contention.

AND HERE WE GO

5. POSITION_CHANGE:
   AND HERE WE GO! We've got a DRAMATIC TURN OF EVENTS unfolding in front of us! Daniel Ricciardo, he's slipped down the order, and it's a BIG fall! He's gone from 10th to 18th in just one lap, an astonishing -8 positions! The lap time: 1 minute, 43.084 seconds, a whopping +16.784 seconds slower than his previous effort! Something's gone terribly wrong for Ricciardo!

OH MY GOODNESS! Let's take a look at the telemetry data. Speed changes, it's a mixed bag. He's lost 13 kilometers per hour on the first sector's entry speed, but only 3 kilometers per hour on the second sector. That's a BIG swing! Sector times, the first sector's time has ballooned by +18.120 seconds, while the third sector's time has actually improved by -2.208 seconds! But it's the second sector that's caught my eye, it's only improved by +0.872 seconds, a tiny gain in a sector that usually requires more speed.

AND WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HIS TIRES? He's gone from the MEDIUM compound to the HARD compound,

6. POSITION_CHANGE:
   AND HERE WE GO! We've got a dramatic position change unfolding right before our eyes! Hulkenberg, the Force India driver, has plummeted down the order, losing EIGHT positions in just one lap! What's gone wrong?

He's just crossed the line, and we're seeing a lap time change that's left everyone stunned. A massive +14.876 seconds! That's a 2.5-second swing in terms of speed. His fastest sector was Sector 3, where he shaved off 3.066 seconds. But Sector 1 was where the real drama unfolded, with a whopping +18.351 seconds added to his time!

AND NOW WE'RE SEEING THE TELEMTRY DATA COMING IN! Speed changes of -2.0 km/h and then +2.0 km/h in the next sector. It's like he's been on a rollercoaster ride out there! Brake pressure is looking inconsistent, and we're seeing some erratic throttle application. It's almost as if he's been struggling to find the correct setup.

AND THE TIRE DATA IS LOOKING ALARMING! A massive -26 laps of tire life lost in just one lap! That's a 25% reduction in

7. TRACK_LIMITS:
   AND HERE WE GO! We're into lap 12 now, and GEORGES RUSSELL, that's GAS to the Sky Sports team, is pushing hard! He's coming into Turn 11, the infamous Turn 11, and OH MY GOODNESS! He's really taking the corners tight, and the speed is building! We've got 245 kilometers per hour, that's 152 miles per hour, as he approaches the turn. This is where the track limits get tricky, folks. One wrong move, and... AND IT'S HAPPENING! He's taking the turn, but the telemetry is telling us he's got a slightly late apex, and... OH DEAR! That's a track limits violation, and it's been detected! 

The deleted time, just 1:26.461, and that's the lap time we're seeing right now. He's not gaining any time with that move, in fact, it's actually costing him. And we're seeing now, with the telemetry analysis, that his speed around the turn was actually a bit lower than usual, just 244 kilometers per hour. Not a huge drop, but enough to trigger the track limits system. AND NOW WE'RE SEEING THE

8. TRACK_LIMITS:
   AND HERE WE GO, FOLKS! WE'RE LIVE ON THE TRACK AS PIA TAKES ON TURN 11! THE CROWD IS ON THE EDGE OF THEIR SEATS, AND WE'RE SEEING SOME EXCELLENT DRIVING TECHNIQUE HERE! PIA'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE FOR POSITIONS, AND SHE'S PUSHING THE LIMITS!

OH MY GOODNESS! LOOK AT THAT BRAKE PRESSURE! 350 PSI, AND SHE'S COMING IN HOT! 243 KILOMETRES PER HOUR, AND SHE'S TAKING THE TURN AT... 4.23 G'S! THAT'S SOME SERIOUS CORNERING SPEED! AND NOW SHE'S OFF THE BRAKES, THROTTLE UP TO 75%, AND SHE'S ALREADY GAINING SPEED!

INCREDIBLE! PIA'S TAKING THE TURN AT FULL THROTTLE NOW, AND SHE'S AT 245 KILOMETRES PER HOUR! THAT'S ONLY 2 KILOMETRES PER HOUR OFF THE MAXIMUM SPEED FOR THIS TURN! WE CAN SEE THE RACING LINE HERE, FOLKS, AND PIA'S RIGHT ON IT!

BUT WAIT

9. COLLISION:
   AND HERE WE GO, FOLKS! WE'VE GOT A HUGE INCIDENT FOLKS, TURN 1, AND IT'S INVOLVING THE TWO HEAVYWEIGHTS, VERSTAPPEN IN CAR 1 AND HAMILTON IN CAR 44! THEY'RE LOCKED HOOKS, AND IT'S LOOKING LIKE WE MIGHT HAVE A COLLISION ON OUR HANDS!

VERSTAPPEN COMING INTO TURN 1, BRAKE PRESSURE AT 4.5 BAR, AND HE'S STRETCHING OUT THE BRAKES, TRYING TO MAXIMIZE THE STOP! 120 KM/H, 110 KM/H... 100 KM/H... AND NOW HE'S STABBING THE THROTTLE! HE'S GETTING ON THE GAS, AND IT'S LOOKING LIKE HE'S TRYING TO CUT THE CORNER, BUT HAMILTON IS RIGHT ON HIS HIP!

HAMILTON, HE'S COMING IN HOT, BRAKE PRESSURE AT 3.8 BAR, LOOKING TO MAXIMIZE THE STABILITY OUT OF THE BRAKE! 130 KM/H, 125 KM/H... 120 KM/H... AND NOW HE'S MAKING THE TURN... WAIT,

10. RACE_SUMMARY:
   (David Crofty's voice booms through the speakers as he begins his final summary of the thrilling F1 race)

OH MY GOODNESS! What a GRAND PRIX we've just witnessed here, folks! The checkered flag has fallen, and Oscar Piastri, the young McLaren sensation, has taken the WINNER'S CHEQUER! What an incredible drive by the Aussie ace!

(Crowd cheers in the background)

Let's take a look at the key moments that unfolded over 70 scintillating laps. We had FIVE INCIDENTS on the track, including that massive SMACKER in Turn 3 between Leclerc's Ferrari and Bottas's Alfa Romeo. The Ferrari suffered a damaged diffuser, while the Alfa Romeo took a new rear wing to make it to the end.

(Cut to footage of the incidents)

And we had 15 MAJOR POSITION CHANGES throughout the field, as drivers battled for every inch on the track. The top 10 was turned on its head multiple times, with only the top six remaining unchanged.

(Cut to the leaderboard)

Now, let's talk about the DRAMA! We had FIVE TRACK LIMITS VIOLATIONS, with some high-profile
