## 1. INCIDENT - Lap 2

**Drivers:** VER vs HAM

**Message:** TURN 1 INCIDENT INVOLVING CAR 1 (VER) NOTED - LEAVING THE TRACK AND GAINING AN ADVANTAGE

**Commentary:**
```
AND HERE WE GO! We're on to lap 2, and Verstappen in the Red Bull is looking strong! He takes the start of the lap, and he's already showing the speed, 246 kilometers per hour as he approaches turn 1. BUT WAIT, WHAT'S THIS? The telemetry is telling us he's got a bit of a slide, just a hint of it, but he's correcting beautifully now. Brake pressure, it's 3000 Newtons, just enough to slow him down, and he's still in control. 

AND THEN HE'S GONE! Verstappen is leaving the track, taking the inside line and gaining a vital advantage over his rivals. The speedo's reading 244 kilometers per hour now, but what impresses me is the way he's carrying that speed through the turn, minimal lockup on the tires, and he's still accelerating out of the corner. The gear is in, I think it's 6th gear, and the revs are at 12,000 RPM. 

UNBELIEVABLE! This is what we've been waiting for, folks, real racing. And he's just gaining on the car ahead, Bottas in the Mercedes.
